Notes:

- Parameters specified above represent the default values for the classic 
  linear Schrodinger equation and may need to be modified to match your
  specific problem.

- You may generate a simple vortex lattice in 2d with the following command:
  ./gpue -x 512 -y 512 -g 50000 -e 1 -p 5000 -W -w 0.5 -n 1e5 -s -l -Z 10

- Thanks for using GPUE!
